# x402 Stacks Sponsor Relay

A Cloudflare Worker that enables gasless transactions for AI agents on the Stacks blockchain by sponsoring and relaying transactions.

## Overview

The [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org/) is an HTTP-native payment standard that uses the HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code to enable instant, autonomous stablecoin payments. This project brings x402 to Stacks by providing a sponsor relay service that:

1. Accepts pre-signed sponsored transactions from agents
2. Validates the transaction format (must be sponsored type)
3. Sponsors the transaction (covers gas fees with our key)
4. Broadcasts to the Stacks network

## Goals

### Primary Goals

- [x] **Gasless agent transactions**: Agents can submit transactions without holding STX for fees
- [ ] **Signature-based auth**: Validate agent identity using SIP-018 structured data signatures (optional)
- [ ] **x402 compatibility**: Integrate with x402 protocol flow for payment verification
- [x] **Stacks-native**: Full support for Stacks transaction types

### Secondary Goals

- [x] **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse with per-sender rate limits (10 req/min)
- [ ] **Spending caps**: Configurable max sponsorship per agent/timeframe
- [x] **Metrics/logging**: Track usage via worker-logs service
- [x] **Multi-network**: Support both mainnet and testnet via config

## Implementation Status

### Completed

- [x] Core `/relay` POST endpoint
- [x] Transaction deserialization and sponsored type validation
- [x] `sponsorTransaction()` integration with @stacks/transactions
- [x] Broadcasting to Stacks network
- [x] In-memory rate limiting per sender
- [x] CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- [x] worker-logs integration for observability
- [x] Test script for end-to-end validation
- [x] x402-stacks fork with `sponsored: true` support (PR #8)

### Pending

- [ ] Deploy to testnet staging
- [ ] End-to-end test with real transactions
- [ ] SIP-018 signature verification
- [ ] x402 payment flow for fee recovery
- [ ] ERC-8004 agent registry integration
- [ ] Persistent rate limiting (KV or Durable Objects)

## Decisions Made

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Agent identity | Start with any Stacks address; ERC-8004 as future milestone |
| Flow origin | Agent calls relay directly |
| Abuse prevention | Rate limits (10 req/min per sender) |
| Payment token | STX, sBTC, USDCx (via x402-stacks) |
| Facilitator | Use existing facilitator.x402stacks.xyz |

## Open Questions (Remaining)

### Protocol Design

1. ~~**Facilitator location**~~: Using existing facilitator.x402stacks.xyz

2. ~~**Payment token**~~: STX, sBTC, USDCx supported via x402-stacks

3. **Payment timing**: Pre-pay (deposit) or pay-per-transaction?
   - Currently: Free sponsorship with rate limits
   - Future: x402 payment flow for fee recovery

4. **Settlement**: On-chain or off-chain accounting?
   - Currently: No settlement (free tier)
   - Future: Clarity contract for deposits/withdrawals?

### Authentication

5. ~~**Agent identity**~~: Any Stacks address; ERC-8004 as milestone

6. **Signature message**: What structured data should agents sign?
   - Currently: Not required
   - Future: SIP-018 domain-separated message

### Operations

7. **Sponsor key management**: Currently Cloudflare Secrets
   - Future: Key rotation? Multiple keys?

8. ~~**Rate limits**~~: 10 req/min per sender (in-memory)
   - Future: Persistent via KV or Durable Objects

9. **Monitoring**: Using worker-logs service
   - Future: Metrics dashboard?

## Next Steps

1. ~~Research existing x402 facilitator implementations~~ ✓

3. Deploy to testnet staging environment
4. End-to-end test with real testnet transactions
5. Add SIP-018 signature verification (optional auth)
6. Add x402 payment layer for fee recovery
7. Design Clarity contract for deposits (if needed)
